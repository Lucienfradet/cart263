The idea is to get input from the face of the user and allow him to be some kind
of living drumming machine

Things to do:
- Get the Face-Api working
- Program events that would play sounds:
  - eyes close
  - mouth Open
  - eyebrows raise
  - head tilt
    - 4 direction?
- Import and atach sounds to the events
