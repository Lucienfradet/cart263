Where's Waldo type game
Lucien Cusson-Fradet

From a city generator, to a terrain generator, to some kind of minecraft digging simulator, the concept of this little program kept on changing as difficulties arose.
You control a purple sphere with the mouse in a 3D environement. When the left mouse button is down, you can remove parts of the terrain.
The idea is to free the clown hidden in the soil.
Once the clown is free and, after some time, the game restarts and the map get's bigger.

I took on a little bit too much with this exercice. Maybe I should've started from the activity like indicated instead of doing something entirely new and different.
In the end I still think I managed to create something fresh, original and visually apealing with which I'm relativly happy.
Appologies again for the late submission, I'll start earlier next time!
