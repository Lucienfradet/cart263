/*********************************************

Here is a description of any special CSS used.
In this case it's just padding and margin to 0
and then centring the canvas (and anything else)
using the CSS Grid.

Also hides overflow.

**********************************************/

body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 15;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide anything that goes off the window size */
}
